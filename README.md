üåç WildCarbon

**WildCarbon** is a blockchain-based platform that creates a sustainable revenue stream for wildlife sanctuaries and national parks by tokenizing the carbon they absorb. Forests and protected ecosystems play a crucial role in fighting climate change by capturing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Yet, these sanctuaries often rely heavily on government grants or tourism for funding, both of which are uncertain and insufficient.

WildCarbon introduces a new model: **Carbon Absorption Tokens (CATs)**. Each token represents a verified unit of CO‚ÇÇ absorbed by a sanctuary. Instead of relying solely on external funding, sanctuaries can mint CATs that reflect their carbon absorption capacity. Companies and individuals seeking to offset their carbon emissions can purchase these tokens directly. This ensures that sanctuaries receive continuous financial support while buyers gain verifiable proof of their commitment to sustainability.

To maintain **transparency and trust**, token minting is not left to sanctuaries alone. WildCarbon employs a **verification layer**: authorized auditors or environmental agencies validate the carbon absorption data before tokens are issued. Each batch of tokens is linked to a certificate stored on the blockchain or IPFS, ensuring immutability and public accountability.

The platform offers three core features:

1. **Sanctuary Dashboard** ‚Äì Enables sanctuaries to request token minting and track their treasury balance.
2. **Company Dashboard** ‚Äì Allows buyers to purchase and burn tokens, receiving blockchain-based certificates of offset.
3. **Transparency Leaderboard** ‚Äì Publicly displays all transactions, supporting organizations, and sanctuaries, reinforcing accountability.

**Tech Stack:**

* Smart Contracts: Solidity (ERC-20 for CAT tokens, ERC-721 for certificates)
* Frontend: React.js with Web3.js/Ethers.js
* Blockchain: Polygon (eco-friendly, low transaction cost)
* Storage: IPFS for certificates and records

**Impact:**
WildCarbon simultaneously addresses **climate change mitigation** and **biodiversity conservation**. By linking carbon markets with wildlife protection, it ensures that sanctuaries are no longer dependent only on unstable funding sources. Instead, they become active participants in the global fight against climate change, with blockchain guaranteeing transparency, trust, and accessibility.

WildCarbon envisions a future where every ton of carbon absorbed by nature directly translates into financial support for ecosystems and the wildlife that depend on them.
